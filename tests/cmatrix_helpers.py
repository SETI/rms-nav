"""Independent inverse helpers shared by the C-matrix tests.

The hermetic and the real-frame C-matrix tests both check the recorded
attitude by recovering the planted offset back out of it.  The recovery is
written from the offset model itself, using only oops FOV primitives, and
imports nothing from the forward path under test: that independence is what
lets it catch a sign, conjugation or composition error.  A helper that
called the implementation would agree with it whatever it did.
