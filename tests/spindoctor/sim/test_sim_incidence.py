"""Artifact-incidence measurement: planted truth equals image-measured count.

Each structural marker-based loss mode is rendered in isolation onto a biased
disc frame (a non-zero floor so the marker stands out from the sky), and the
image-only estimator is asserted to recover exactly the count the telemetry
stage recorded in the frame truth.  The planted side is exact by construction;
these tests pin the image side to it.  Modes that plant wrong values rather than
the marker (garble, spikes, detector electronics) are out of scope for the
image estimators and are covered only through :func:`planted_incidence`.
