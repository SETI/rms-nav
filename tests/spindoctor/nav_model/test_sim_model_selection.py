"""Model selection for simulated observations.

A simulated obs must build the sim-params-driven NavModels (not the SPICE-backed
ones), and the real models must opt out of a simulated obs.  Titan is the one
body routed away from the generic body model on both sides: its haze hides the
surface an ellipsoid prediction assumes, so it belongs to the haze model alone
and the two must never both claim it.
