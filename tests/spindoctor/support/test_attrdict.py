"""Hermetic tests for ``spindoctor.support.attrdict``.

The class publishes its own dict as its ``__dict__``, which is what makes
attribute access work and is also its one hazard: an attribute set on one of
these objects is a key inserted into configuration data.  oops does that, by
caching its mutability verdict on every object it walks, so the class carries
oops's opt-out marker.  These tests stand in for oops rather than importing it,
so they pin the contract the marker relies on without needing a kernel pool.

    That function walks whatever it can reach from an observation and caches its
    verdict by setting ``_MUTABLE_info`` on each object, skipping any object that
    carries ``_IS_IMMUTABLE``.  Reproduced here rather than called, so the two
    names this class depends on are pinned without a kernel pool.

    oops itself always skips a marked object; ``honor_marker=False`` is the
    counterfactual, kept so the tests can show what the walk writes into a
    mapping that carries no marker.

    Parameters:
        obj: The object to inspect.
        honor_marker: True to skip an object carrying ``_IS_IMMUTABLE``, which is
            what oops does; False to write unconditionally.
