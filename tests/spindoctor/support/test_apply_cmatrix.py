"""Hermetic tests for ``apply_cmatrix_to_obs``, the reading half of the C-matrix work.

Every test builds its own FOV, attitudes and observation stub, so nothing here
depends on SPICE kernels or holdings.  Each directional test is named for the
mutation it pins: a change that flips a sign, transposes a matrix, skips the
conjugation, or removes the identity short-circuit must fail the named test.
The instrument table lookup is injected via ``_frame_identity`` so a synthetic
flip -- including the non-involutory quarter turn no real instrument has -- can
pin the conjugation's direction.
