"""Hermetic tests for ``spindoctor.support.cmatrix``.

Every test here builds its own FOV and its own attitudes, so nothing depends
on SPICE kernels or on a real observation.  The conventions under test are
the ones a hermetic test can silently get wrong in both directions at once:
the sign of the tangent-plane offset, the direction of the rotation
``cspyce.axisar`` builds, and the conjugation of the oops-frame correction
into the SPICE frame.  Each is pinned by recovering the planted offset back
out of the recorded C-matrix with an independent inverse.
