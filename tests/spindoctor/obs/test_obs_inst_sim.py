"""ObsSim construction: renderer output metadata and scene-path handling.

``ObsSim.from_file`` renders the scene and stores the renderer's truth-side
output on the snapshot for the image-side consumers (recovery scoring, the
backplane writer).  These tests guard the per-body mask map: a renderer
change that stops populating ``body_mask_map`` degrades those consumers
silently, because nothing on the navigation path reads it.

They also guard how the scene path is resolved.  A scene handed over in
memory names no file, so resolving it must not reach storage; a scene named
by a file or a URL must be fetched before it can be parsed.
