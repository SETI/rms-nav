"""What a listing of named documents answers, and which call it answers with.

A selection that names its stubs asks about those files and no others, which is
what a caller enumerating candidate images asks: which of the ones this run might
still keep has a document.  Nothing about the answer depends on how it was
reached, and everything about what it costs does, so the source picks the call
that is cheap on the root it is answering about -- a check per file where a check
is a syscall, a walk of the directories they lie in where it is a paid round
trip.

Both branches are exercised here against the same stated answers, and each is
held to using its own call and not the other's: a test that only ever ran the
local branch would pass for a source that had no other, and the branch nobody
can reach on a workstation is the one a cloud run takes every time.  The remote
branch is driven through a results root the storage layer answers about as a
remote location while serving it out of a directory, which is the whole of what
the choice turns on.

The two do not answer alike about everything, and the difference is stated
rather than papered over: only a walk reads a directory entry, so only a walk can
report an entry's size and modification time.
