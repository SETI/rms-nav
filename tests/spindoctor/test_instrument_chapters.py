"""Every registered instrument has a chapter in each guide, following the template.

Two failures are prevented here, and both are silent under review. A registered
instrument with no chapter reads as an instrument nobody has documented rather
than as one whose documentation was forgotten. A chapter missing one of the
template's sections reads as a question nobody thought to ask, rather than as
one whose honest answer is "none" -- which is why the template requires the
heading to be present even when the section says ``None.``

The chapter a registered instrument must have is derived from that instrument's
own observation module (``obs_inst_cassini_iss`` yields ``cassini_iss``), so
registering an instrument is what creates the requirement. Nothing in this
module enumerates instruments, and adding one needs no edit here.
