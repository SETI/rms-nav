"""What the filter says about the pass whose answer it is handing on.

An index answers as of the pass that filled it and detects no change since, so
one thing travels with the answer: when that pass finished, which is what a
reader compares against what they know they have navigated.

It is read from the newest run row of the root being enumerated, and every test
here builds a second root whose pass ran afterwards and recorded a time of its
own, so an answer taken from the newest run of the table rather than of the root
says so.
