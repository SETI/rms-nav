"""Every answer the index gives differently from the tree, one test each.

Two of them: a file the ingest pass could not retrieve, and a document rewritten
in place keeping the length and the modification time it had before.  Each is a
property of what one pass could read and record rather than of a query, and each
is enumerated in :mod:`spindoctor.dataset.results_filter`, in the navigation
guide, in the plan, and here.  They are tested in both directions -- what the
tree answers and what the index answers -- because what makes each a divergence
is that the two differ, and an assertion about one of them alone would pass if
the other silently changed to match.

A member added to the enumeration is added here.  One that stops being a
divergence keeps a test and loses this file: what made it worth a test is that
the two answers could differ, which is as true of the answer that matches as of
the one that did not, so the test moves to the parity file and asserts the
agreement there.
