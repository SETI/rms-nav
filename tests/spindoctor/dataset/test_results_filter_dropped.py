"""What a scan says about the candidates it could read no navigation record out of.

An error filter asks what a document records, so a file that yields no facts
satisfies none of them, the one phrased in the negative included.  A document
written to an earlier metadata schema is such a file, and a results root holding
nothing else therefore answers every error filter with no image at all --
including the filter whose whole purpose is finding the images to run again.

That is an answer a run has to be told about, because a selection short for this
reason is otherwise indistinguishable from a root holding no such image.  So the
scan counts the candidates it read nothing out of and names one of them with the
reason.  It says it once, when the enumeration is done with the filter, since a
root holding hundreds of them would otherwise bury the selection the run asked
for under the report of what it passed over.
