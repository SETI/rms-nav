"""The merge of the three streams, against the order a backend hands rows back in.

An image and its child rows are read as three separate statements and paired up
in one pass, which can only be right while all three arrive in one order.  The
index the tests here build is written so that insertion order pairs every image
with the wrong one: a merge reading the streams off against each other by
position hands each image another image's children.

That the statements ask for that order is pinned by reading the statements
themselves rather than the source, because a backend is free to answer a join off
a child table's own index and hand the rows back in key order whether or not the
statement said to sort them.  And a child row belonging to no image the stream
yields has to fail the read: a merge that waits for one to the end of the pass
gives every image after it an empty list indistinguishable from an image with no
rows of its own.

    What this shape shows is that the merge pairs a child row with its image by
    the key it carries: written back to front, insertion order pairs every image
    with the wrong one, so a merge reading the two streams off against each
    other by position hands each image another image's children.

    What it does not show is that the statements ask for an order.  The child
    read joins to ``images`` on the key, and a backend is free to answer that
    join off the child table's own unique index and hand the rows back in key
    order whether or not the statement said to sort them, which is what SQLite

    themselves, and what it costs when they do not is pinned on the tier that
    runs against a planner free to choose otherwise.
