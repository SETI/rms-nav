"""Shared fixtures and row factories for the results-index tests.

The row factories exist so a test that cares about one column does not have to
restate the NOT NULL columns around it, and so a column gaining a constraint
fails in one place rather than in every test.

The PostgreSQL fixtures give each test its own schema.  Two workers of a parallel
run, or two runs against the same server, otherwise share one set of tables and
see one another's rows.

The two results roots and the accessors over a stream of facts are shared by the
several modules that read that one pair of roots from different angles.  Two
things are built into them because both are this codebase's own defect classes.

**Two roots, and the second differs in the value under test.**  The key is
``(root_url, results_path_stub)``, one index serves several roots, and a query
that filters on the stub alone passes every single-root test there is.  So both
roots hold the same stubs with different values, and the comparisons are made
against each of them in turn: a query that dropped the root answers out of
whichever row the server reached first, and one of the two directions catches it.

**Neither backend's order is trusted.**  Both streams are sorted in Python
before anything is compared, on the whole key, and so are the child rows within
one image, because the index stores no ordinal for a technique and a server
returns rows of one key in whatever order it likes.
