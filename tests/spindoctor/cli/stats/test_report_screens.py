"""The report sections whose fixtures a tree of ordinary images cannot supply.

Four sections say something only about images built to make them say it, and the
frozen regression tree holds none of those images.  It has one image size per
camera, so the per-camera statistics are never a pool of anything.  Every one of
its successes is far inside the search box and no two of its Cassini frames
share a spacecraft-clock count, so no table it produces is ever capped and no
reduction it makes ever has two candidates to choose between.  And every
document in it either succeeded or failed outright, so nothing in it is an image
the navigator could not decide about.

Each fixture here is written for one of those, and each is small enough that the
number the section prints can be worked out by hand from the offsets that went
in.
