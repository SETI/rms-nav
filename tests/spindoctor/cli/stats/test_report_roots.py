"""What a report covers, root by root, and what it says about a root it did not.

One index serves several results roots and one report may span them, so the root
is half of every key the report reads and the whole of what it can be narrowed
to without opening a document.  Two things follow, and both are measured here
over two roots that differ in the value under test: a report handed two roots
covers both of them, and a report that could be bound to only some of the roots
it was pointed at says which ones those were.

A root whose newest ingest run never finished is the second case.  Its rows are
in the index and mean nothing -- absence under it is absence of a pass rather
than absence of an image -- so the report covers none of it, and a narrowing
nobody could see would read as an answer about the whole index.
