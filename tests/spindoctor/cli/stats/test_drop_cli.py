"""Tests for ``sd_stats_ingest --drop-index``.

The destructive command, so what is asked of it is mostly what it does *not* do:
it does not drop without an answer, it does not treat a closed standard input as
consent, it does not walk a tree, it does not print a password, and it does not
leave behind a database anything reads differently from one nobody ever built.

The last of those is asked of the real consumer entry points rather than
asserted about the schema, because "indistinguishable to every consumer" is a
statement about them.
