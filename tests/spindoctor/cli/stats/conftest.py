"""Tree and index helpers for the statistics report tests.

The document factories the trees here are built out of are shared with the rest
of the subtree and live in ``tests/spindoctor/conftest.py``, and the pass that
writes an index is defined once beside the tests of that pass, in
``tests/spindoctor/cli/results_index/conftest.py``.  What is left here is the
frozen fixture tree, the report invocations measured against it, and the
sources a report is handed.

:class:`ReplayedFacts` is here because a source promises no order, and the way
to measure that a report does not depend on one is to hand it the same facts in
an order the test chose.  Two modules do that -- one over a whole report, one
over a section whose reduction has two candidates to choose between -- so the
stand-in source is written once.
