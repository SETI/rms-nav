"""Hermetic tests for the pointing selection ladder and its application.

``select_pointing`` classifies one image's parsed navigation record into a
mechanism (C-matrix, offset, or none) with a per-reason short form, and
``apply_pointing_to_obs`` applies the classification to a real oops
observation.  Every test builds its own record and its own observation on the
built-in SSB path and J2000 frame, so nothing here touches SPICE kernels or
holdings; the instrument table lookup inside the C-matrix reader is injected,
exactly as the reader's own unit tests inject it.
