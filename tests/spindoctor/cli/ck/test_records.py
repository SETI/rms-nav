"""The two ways a C-kernel run gets its navigation records, held to each other.

A run reads every document of one mission under a results root, from the tree
or from a results index.  What the readers downstream do with them must not
depend on which: the same images, in the same order, eligible or omitted for
the same reasons, with the same matrices, epochs, kernels and reported facts.
So the tests here drive both sources over one tree and compare what the
generator's own readers make of each.

The one difference the seam permits is tested too, as a difference: a value the
ingest could not store is rebuilt as one the document never recorded, so the
index path reports an image whose record the tree path refuses outright.
