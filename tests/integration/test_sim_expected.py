"""Expected-outcome regression for sim scenes carrying an ``expected`` block.

Discovers every catalog scene with a scene-level ``expected`` block, renders and
navigates it in-process, and asserts the fused outcome matches the declaration
through the :mod:`tests.integration.sim_expected` machinery.  Two scene kinds
live here: the false-positive-characterization scenes (a wrong-catalog or
overwhelming-clutter frame whose CORRECT outcome is failure / low confidence,
asserted so a confident wrong offset is a test failure) and the honest pins
(scenes whose confidently wrong offset is a documented, currently unmitigated
hazard: ``known_offset_error_px`` bands the measured error so a worsening
regression fails and a genuine fix fails loudly for a deliberate re-pin).

Navigation is heavier than the structural checks (each scene renders and runs
the full ensemble), so the module is ``@pytest.mark.integration`` -- the same
deliberate tier as the baselines and sweeps.  It needs no holdings or SPICE.
