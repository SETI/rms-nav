"""Expected-outcome assertion machinery for sim scenes (the ``expected`` block).

A sim scene may carry a scene-level ``expected`` block declaring the outcome the
navigator should produce: a ``status`` (``success`` / ``failed`` / ``conflicted``),
an optional ``confidence_tier`` (one of the five navigation ranks, or null to
assert the status only), an optional ``status_reason``, and an optional honest
pin ``known_offset_error_px`` / ``known_offset_error_tol_px`` pair.  This module
loads that block and asserts a
:class:`~spindoctor.nav_orchestrator.nav_result.NavResult` against it with clear
failure messages.

It is the sim analog of the image-library sidecar's expected-outcome regression,
modeled on that taxonomy (status / confidence_tier / status_reason and its
cross-field rules) but implemented independently: a sim scene is not a sidecar,
so nothing here imports ``tests.integration.sidecar``.  The ``expected`` block is
a test-only scene key -- read here, fed to neither the renderer nor the
navigator, and stripped from ``nav_params`` by the information boundary.

The machinery asserts two distinct patterns:

- **Expected-fail scenes.**  When a scene renders every star in the wrong
  place, or an overwhelming confounder field, the CORRECT navigation outcome
  is a failed / low-confidence result, and the status / tier assertion turns
  that requirement into a test.
- **Honest pins.**  A few scenes produce a confidently wrong offset the
  ensemble cannot currently detect (a planted radial catalog error absorbed
  into a high-tier ring lock, a high-phase haze crescent dragging the blob
  centroid).  Their pinned ``status: success`` is NOT an endorsement -- it is
  a documented hazard held in view.  For those scenes ``known_offset_error_px``
  states the measured fused error magnitude and ``known_offset_error_tol_px``
  its band, and the assertion fails when the measured error leaves the band in
  either direction: a worsening regression fails, and a genuine fix also fails
  loudly, prompting a deliberate re-pin instead of a silent behavior change.

    The status is always checked; the confidence tier and the status_reason are

    (``known_offset_error_px``), the measured fused error magnitude against the
