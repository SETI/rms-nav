"""Navigation under structured telemetry loss (the artifact stress axis).

Each scene under ``sim_scenes/artifact_sweep/`` plants a modest structured
telemetry loss (a few whole missing lines plus a few truncated lines per frame)
on top of a clean planted-offset frame, in a uniform-placement and an
adversarial-placement variant.  These tests navigate each scene and assert the
navigator still reaches success and recovers the planted offset within tolerance
-- the survivable end of the artifact axis, the level at which realism does not
break navigation.  Everything is in-process (no holdings or SPICE), so these run
alongside the other planted-offset invariants.

Unlike the algorithmic invariants these are not correct-by-construction (loss is
stochastic per seed), so they are pinned scenes with committed baselines; the
tolerance here is the survivability claim, not an exact recovery.
