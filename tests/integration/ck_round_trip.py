"""The three processes of the corrected-pointing round trip.

Navigation measures a pointing correction; the C-kernel writer turns it into a
kernel; a consumer furnishes that kernel and gets corrected geometry.  This
module runs that loop end to end on one real image, as three steps meant to be
run in three separate processes:

``navigate``
    Navigate the image the way the pipeline does, writing the per-image
    metadata the kernel writer reads, plus the list of kernels oops furnished
    while doing it.
``generate``
    Pair the image with the baseline kernel it navigated against and write the
    corrected kernel, recording the corrected camera attitude the written
    segment claims at the exposure start, midtime and stop.
``renavigate``
    Load the image again in a fresh process, furnish the corrected kernel, read
    back the camera attitude at those three epochs, and navigate again.

Three processes rather than one, because oops caches frames and manages its own
kernel pool: a ``furnsh`` in the middle of a process that has already navigated
is not guaranteed to take effect, and a round trip that quietly measured the
uncorrected pointing twice would pass.  Each step writes its findings to a JSON
file in a shared working directory, and the test that drives the three reads
those files and does the deciding.  Nothing here asserts: a step that cannot do
its job raises, and everything else is a measurement for the caller to judge.

Two facts about the re-navigation step are worth stating, because they are what
make it a real test rather than a formality:

- The corrected kernel is furnished **after** the host's ``from_file`` returns,
  since that is when oops has finished furnishing the originals, and SPICE
  gives precedence to the C-kernel furnished last.  Furnishing it earlier would
  put it underneath the originals, where it would be silently ignored.
- A host that freezes its observation frame while ``from_file`` runs -- which is
  what Voyager ISS does, building a fixed attitude out of one tolerance-snapped
  pointing lookup -- cannot see a kernel furnished after that call returns at
  all.  For those hosts the image is loaded a second time, with the correction
  already furnished, and the second observation is the one navigated.  The
  attitude readback then reports what the whole pool answers, so a correction
  that failed to take effect is visible either way.
