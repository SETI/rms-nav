"""Pose-disagreement behavioral test for an irregular body.

A chaotic rotator's orientation is genuinely unknown, so the useful question is
what the technique ladder does when the navigator's assumed pose is wrong.  This
test renders one irregular body at its true pose and navigates it twice: once
with the predicted pose agreeing with the render (the correct-pose body) and once
with the predicted body given a wrong in-plane roll (the wrong-pose body).  It
asserts the *decision*, per technique, not an exact recovery:

* The orientation-dependent ``BodyLimbNav`` recovers the planted offset at the
  correct pose but lands far off at the wrong pose -- a wrong-pose limb the
  navigator should not trust (here it also self-flags spurious).
* The orientation-free ``BodyBlobNav`` stays accurate at both poses, because the
  body's bulk shape is a centrally-symmetric triaxial ellipsoid whose
  lit-weighted centroid barely moves under rotation.

A wrong in-plane roll is used because it swings the elongated body's silhouette
the most for the least centroid motion, giving the cleanest separation between
the limb (which depends on the silhouette) and the blob (which does not).  The
assertion is per-technique because the ensemble's demote-to-pose-free choice is
confidence-driven and the confidence alphas are uncalibrated placeholders; the
geometry/error gap asserted here is real and placeholder-independent.  The fused
"prefers the pose-free answer" claim only becomes clean after the real-data
confidence calibration.
