"""The corrected-pointing round trip, on real images against real kernels.

This is the acceptance test of the C-kernel work: navigate a real image, write
the corrected kernel its measurement implies, furnish that kernel in a fresh
process, and navigate the same image again.  If everything from the C-matrix
convention through the segment writer to the baseline pairing is right, the
second navigation finds nothing left to correct.

The three steps run as three subprocesses, because oops caches frames and
manages its own kernel pool; :mod:`tests.integration.ck_round_trip` is the
program each subprocess runs, and this module reads what the three of them
wrote and does the deciding.

What is asserted, and why in these units:

- **The pointing actually changed.**  Read straight from the kernel pool at the
  exposure midtime, the camera attitude has moved from the one navigation
  recorded by exactly the offset navigation measured.  Without this, a kernel
  that was furnished underneath the originals and silently ignored would leave
  the re-navigation measuring the same offset as the first run and, on a frame
  whose offset happened to be small, look like a pass.
- **The record epochs read back exactly.**  A segment carries records at the
  exposure start, midtime and stop; those are the epochs this plan claims, and
  the readback is compared against what the segment says rather than against
  what it was meant to say.  Interior epochs are deliberately not asserted: the
  record scheme does not bound them, and a longer exposure's 1 s cadence
  records are reproduced just as exactly but exist only on long exposures.
- **The re-navigated offset is zero.**  This is the end-to-end statement, and
  the only one whose residual is not pure floating-point noise: the pointing
  chain reproduces to 1e-15 radians, while a second navigation of a corrected
  frame lands within a few thousandths of a pixel of zero because the
  techniques re-measure rather than recompute.  A convention error anywhere in
  the chain would leave roughly twice the original offset here, which is
  several pixels on every frame in the cohort.
- **Both runs committed the same techniques, and the same ones carried
  weight.**  The comparison above is only meaningful when the same measurement
  was repeated; a run that committed a different set, or in which a technique's
  confidence collapsed, has not been shown to agree or to disagree, so the test
  fails as inconclusive rather than passing.

The cohort is one star-navigated Cassini NAC frame, one Cassini WAC frame, one
Voyager frame and one New Horizons LORRI frame, and a fifth frame -- a Cassini
WAC view of a resolved body -- carries the pointing assertions but not the
offset one, because on that frame the offset measures the navigation techniques
rather than the pointing.  Galileo SSI cannot take part at all and is tested for
exactly that: its navigation fits a camera rotation, whose pivot no result
records, so it records no corrected attitude to write.
