"""Staleness guard for the committed documentation-gallery images.

The gallery PNGs under ``docs/dev_guide/_sim_images/`` and
``docs/simulator_report/_scene_images/`` are committed Sphinx assets written
by ``python -m tests.integration.sim_doc_images``; any change that alters
rendered output must regenerate them in the same change.  This module
enforces that rule mechanically: it regenerates every gallery image into a
temporary directory and asserts each committed PNG is byte-identical to its
fresh counterpart, failing with the list of stale files and the regeneration
command to run.

Regenerating both galleries renders a few dozen small frames, so the module
is ``@pytest.mark.integration`` like the render budget -- the deliberate
tier, not the fast unit suite.  Everything renders in-process (no holdings
or SPICE).
