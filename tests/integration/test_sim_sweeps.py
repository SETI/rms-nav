"""Single-variable sweep invariants.

Each sweep drives one catalog scene by varying a single parameter and navigates
every step.  These tests assert how a navigation diagnostic *responds* to the
controlled change -- the verification layer a calibrated confidence formula
relies on.  Assertions are trends and bounds (a technique transition, a
degradation to failure, recovery within tolerance), not exact values, because the
underlying navigation carries sub-millipixel cross-process jitter.

Run in-process; heavier than the algorithmic invariants (each sweep navigates
several frames), so the module is ``@pytest.mark.integration`` -- the deliberate
tier, alongside the baselines.
