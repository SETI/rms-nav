"""Behavioral checks for the mutual-event scene class.

A grazing two-body overlap must still navigate to its planted offset within
tolerance, and the navigator-side simulated body model must predict
occlusion-aware limbs: the near body's limb stays complete, while the far
body's limb loses the arc hidden behind the near body's silhouette and its
``visible_arc_fraction`` reports the loss honestly (the input the limb
reliability and BodyLimbNav's confidence formula consume).  The deeper
overlaps' fused outcomes are pinned by their scenes' ``expected`` blocks
(test_sim_expected) and their baselines.

Everything renders and navigates in-process (no holdings or SPICE), so this
runs in the default suite.
