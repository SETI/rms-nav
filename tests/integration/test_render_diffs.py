"""Currency guard for the committed render-diff review artifacts.

``tests/integration/render_diffs/`` is a standing review artifact (see
``tests/integration/render_contact_sheet.py``): one committed
``current/<scene>.png`` per catalog scene and one ``sheet_<class>.png`` per
scene class.  This module enforces the regeneration rule mechanically, the
way ``test_sim_doc_images`` guards the documentation galleries:

* Every catalog scene's committed ``current/`` PNG must be byte-identical to
  a fresh render encoded through the generator's own PNG path, and no
  ``current/`` PNG may outlive its scene.
* Every scene class present in the catalog must have a committed sheet, and
  no sheet may outlive its class.

The sheets are checked for presence and coverage only, never for byte
identity: a sheet's pixels legitimately encode the *previous* baseline's
before-panels (they show the last reviewed transition, which a fresh
regeneration would erase), and its text labels rasterize through PIL's
``ImageDraw`` default font, whose output is environment-dependent.  The
per-scene ``current/`` PNGs carry none of that -- they are pure encoded
renders -- so byte identity is asserted exactly there.
