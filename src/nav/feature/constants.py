"""Module-level constants used across feature extraction and reliability scoring.

These constants encode physically-motivated thresholds and caps referenced
across feature-extraction and confidence-scoring formulas.  Keeping them in
one file makes the formulas self-documenting at the point of use and gives
a single edit-site when calibration changes their values.

Each constant carries a one-line docstring with units and intent.  Constants
that have a YAML-config equivalent (per-instrument tunables) belong in the
config files; only physically-motivated values live here.
