"""Ring feature filter pipeline.

This module implements a four-pass filter that decides which ring features (and which
edges within each feature) are included in the final render. It is deliberately
separated from the rendering logic in ``ring_feature.py`` for two reasons:

1. **Single responsibility**: A feature object knows how to render itself; the filter
   knows which features are *worth* rendering for a given observation. These are
   distinct concerns -- a feature's physics do not change based on whether it is
   currently visible.

2. **Testability**: The filter is a pure function of its inputs (features + observation
   parameters). It can be tested independently of backplane computation. Rendering
   involves complex oops backplane calls that require mocking; the filter only needs
   simple numeric comparisons.

Pass 4 (fade conflict) checks individual edges, not whole features, because:

- A GAP feature has two fade edges that shade independently in opposite directions.
  The outer edge shading outward may be clear of conflicts while the inner edge
  shading inward is blocked -- the outer edge is still useful for navigation.
- Excluding the whole feature because one edge is blocked would silently remove
  valid navigation signals.

**Pipeline order rationale**:

1. Date (cheapest: pure arithmetic) eliminates features not valid for this image.
2. Radius eliminates features outside the current field of view.
3. Resolvability eliminates two-edge features too narrow to see as a width.
4. Fade conflict (most expensive: needs all surviving edge radii) eliminates or trims
   individual fade-using edges that are squeezed by a neighbor.

Processing in this order means expensive operations run only on the smaller set of
features that survive the cheaper passes.

        Non-fade edges (inner and outer edges of full ringlets where both edges are
        present) always pass because they are rendered solid and do not use fade.

        For fade-using edges:
        - Compute ``fade_width_km = fade_width_pix * min_res`` at the edge.
        - Reduce ``fade_width_km`` to ``half_dist`` when a neighbor is in the shade
          direction within the original fade zone.
        - Exclude if the reduced width < ``min_allowed_fade_width_pix * min_res``.

        The shade direction is ``shade_above`` (True = outward, False = inward):
        - RINGLET inner: shade_above=True (fade outward)
        - RINGLET outer: shade_above=False (fade inward)
        - GAP inner: shade_above=False (fade inward / into gap)
        - GAP outer: shade_above=True (fade outward / into gap)

        Parameters:
            feature: The feature whose edge is being checked.
            edge_type: 'inner' or 'outer'.
            all_edge_radii: All surviving edge radii for conflict lookup.

        Returns:
            True if the edge should be kept.
