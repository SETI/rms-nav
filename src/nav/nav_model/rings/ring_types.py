"""Immutable data types for ring feature orbital parameters.

This module defines the core value objects that represent ring edge orbital
data: ``RingFeatureType``, ``RingBaseOrbitMode``, ``RingPerturbationMode``,
and ``RingEdgeData``. These are frozen dataclasses (immutable) because orbital
parameters from YAML config are physical constants that should never be modified
after loading. Validation occurs at construction time so that downstream
rendering code can trust the data without defensive checks.

Separating these types into their own module keeps them free of rendering
dependencies (oops, numpy), enabling lightweight import for testing and for
the simulated model which uses the types for data validation but does not use
backplane rendering.

Design notes:

- ``RingBaseOrbitMode`` and ``RingPerturbationMode`` are distinct types to
  resolve the ambiguity in the YAML config where ``mode: 1`` can appear with
  either base-orbit fields (``a``, ``ae``, ...) or perturbation fields
  (``amplitude``, ``phase``, ...). Having separate types makes the dispatch
  explicit in ``RingFeature.from_config()``.

- Inclination modes (``mode_num > 90``) are stored in ``RingEdgeData.perturbations``
  because they are valid YAML data. However, ``RingEdgeData.radial_perturbations()``
  and ``parsed_modes_for_backplane()`` exclude them, because the ``oops`` backplane
  ``radial_mode()`` function only handles radial (in-plane) perturbations. Making
  the limitation visible here rather than silently skipping them in rendering code
  surfaces the issue for future implementors.
