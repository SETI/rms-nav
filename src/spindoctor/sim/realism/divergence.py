"""Wasserstein-1 divergence and cohort-support labeling for the realism match.

The scalar divergence reported for every figure of merit is the Wasserstein-1
distance computed on quantile-clipped data (1st-99th percentile), normalized
by the real distribution's interquartile range.  W1 is a transport metric in
the variable's own units -- the actual reason to use it -- but it is not
outlier-robust (it grows linearly with displaced-tail distance), so the clip
keeps a noise statistic from silently measuring an artifact statistic's
tails.  No pass/fail threshold is attached; the number is reported per figure
of merit and read by a human.

Each sample is winsorized at its *own* 1st/99th percentiles.  Clipping the
sim sample at the real sample's bounds would cap the measured displacement of
a grossly wrong sim distribution, hiding exactly the mismatch the statistic
exists to surface; clipping each sample at its own tails removes only that
sample's outliers while preserving bulk displacement.
