"""Sky-region noise statistics for realism FOM 1.

Science frames have no flat-field pairs, so noise is estimated by local
differencing inside near-uniform patches: paired horizontal pixel
differences cancel scene structure that varies slowly across the patch,
and dividing the difference scale by sqrt(2) recovers the per-pixel sigma.
A robust (MAD-based) scale keeps residual stars, cosmic rays, and hot
pixels in a patch from inflating the estimate; naive signal-binning would
conflate scene texture with noise, which is exactly what this estimator
avoids.

The sky spatial power spectrum (radially averaged over annuli of spatial
frequency) catches banding and coherent noise that a scalar sigma cannot:
white read noise is flat, banding is a comb.
