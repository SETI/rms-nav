"""Measured artifact incidence rates for realism FOM 6.

These detectors measure, per frame, the rates of the artifact classes the
catalog defaults describe: line loss (missing / interpolated rows),
stationary hot pixels, and transient single-pixel spikes (cosmic rays and
radiation hits).  The same detectors run on real cohort frames and matched
sim frames, so a detector's bias cancels in the comparison; the absolute
rates additionally document the cohort against the catalog's per-instrument
defaults (loss modes default to zero incidence under instrument_defaults --
FOM 6 is the evidence for keeping or replacing those zeros).

The hot-pixel / transient-spike split needs more than one frame: a spike
that recurs at one detector position across frames is a hot pixel, one that
does not is a transient.  ``measure_artifact_incidence`` therefore reports
per-frame spike candidates, and ``split_stationary_spikes`` performs the
cross-frame split.

    Line loss: a row counts as lost when it is constant while its
    neighbors are not, or when it exactly equals the mean of the adjacent
    rows (the interpolation a telemetry gap filler leaves).  Constant rows
    in an all-constant frame (a blank frame) are not counted.

    Spikes: a pixel counts as a spike when it exceeds its 3x3
    median-filtered surrounding by ``spike_nsigma`` times the frame's
    robust noise sigma.  This catches hot pixels and cosmic rays; scene
    point sources brighter than the threshold are also caught, which is
    why the comparison runs the same detector on both cohorts.

    Parameters:
