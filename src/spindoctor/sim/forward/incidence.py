"""Artifact-incidence measurement: planted truth vs image-measured counts.

The realism match compares how many defects a scene *planted* against how many a
detector could *measure* on the rendered frame.  This module carries both sides:

* :func:`planted_incidence` reads the realized geometry the telemetry stage
  wrote into ``frame.truth['artifacts']`` and returns a realized event count per
  mode (lost lines, truncated lines, lost blocks, dropped or spiked pixels, dead
  columns, or a commanded on/off).  This is ground truth: it is exact by
  construction, since each applier records exactly what it touched.

* The ``measured_*`` estimators recover the same counts from the DN image alone,
  the way a detector run against a real archive frame would, with no access to
  the truth record.  They key on the missing-data marker (the DN a lost pixel
  carries: 0 on the raw-DN path, NaN on the calibrated path), so they are exact
  for the marker-based structural modes and only those.

**Scope of the image estimators.**  A lost line, a truncated line, a lost block,
and a dead pixel each overwrite pixels with the marker value, so a marker-run
analysis recovers them exactly on a frame whose scene content is not itself at
the marker level (a body or star frame with a non-zero bias floor; the dark-sky
floor of an unbiased frame sits at the marker and is indistinguishable from a
dropout).  Modes that plant *wrong* values rather than the marker -- garble
(random DN), pixel spikes (bit-flips), and every detector-electronics mode --
are not recoverable pixel-by-pixel from a single frame: distinguishing them from
scene structure needs multi-frame or noise statistics, which is out of scope
here.  For those modes, use :func:`planted_incidence` (the truth side) only.
