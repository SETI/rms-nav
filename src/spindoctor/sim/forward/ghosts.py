"""Ghost reflections for the optics stage.

A ghost is a faint internal reflection of the focal-plane image: a displaced,
defocused, low-amplitude copy of the scene added back onto it.  A bright star
casts a ghost the same way an extended source does, so each ghost reflects both
the intensive signal (bodies, rings, sky) and the point-source plane (stars).
Each ghost copies the pre-ghost planes (so ghosts do not reflect one another),
shifts them by its offset, blurs them by its defocus, scales them by its
amplitude, and adds them back in.
