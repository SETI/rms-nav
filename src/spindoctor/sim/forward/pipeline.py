"""The fixed-order stage pipeline of the forward model.

Stage order is physical and does not vary per scene: scene radiance is
composed, passes through the optics, is downsampled to the detector grid,
is read out through the detector model, and is then subjected to telemetry
loss.  A stage whose scene block is absent contributes nothing, so a
single-variable sweep can attribute error to exactly one effect.

Each stage draws from its own ``numpy.random.Generator`` seeded by
``derive_effect_seed(random_seed, '<stage-name>')``: stage noise
realizations are independent of which other stages are enabled, and adding
a stage later leaves existing stages' realizations unchanged.  Renaming a
stage reseeds its scenes and regenerates their baselines.
