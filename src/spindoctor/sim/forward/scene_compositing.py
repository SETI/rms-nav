"""Translucent-screen compositing and depth-ambiguity checks for the radiance stage.

The radiance stage (:mod:`spindoctor.sim.forward.scene_radiance`) paints the
opaque body stack far to near and then composites the scene's translucent
screens -- the optical-depth ring system and the atmospheric bodies' above-limb
halos -- over the painted image.  This module owns that compositing machinery:
:func:`translucent_screen_ops` orders the screens far to near (the ring's
per-pixel depth interleaving with the halos' scalar body ranges) and returns
them as :class:`ScreenOp` applications, and the ``check_*`` functions enforce
the depth contract behind every ordering decision -- overlapping objects must
ALL carry an explicit scene ``range_km``, or their stacking would be a silent
guess and the scene fails loudly.

Everything here operates on rendered geometry the radiance stage hands in
(painted masks, halo screens, ring maps); no scene mapping is read directly.
