"""Key inventory and information-boundary classification for sim scenes.

Every top-level and per-object key a scene may carry is inventoried here
(unknown keys fail validation so typos do not silently render the default
scene), and every inventory key is classified as either idealized
(information the production pipeline could know from catalogs, SPICE, labels,
or config: exposed to the navigator through ``obs.nav_params``), truth
(nature's values, planted errors, variance knobs, and contaminants: readable
only by the image-side renderer), or test-only (the scene's expected
navigation outcome: read by the integration-test assertion machinery, and by
neither the renderer nor the navigator).  :data:`TRUTH_KEYS` is the
machine-readable truth set the ObsSim boundary filter strips and the
structural boundary test iterates; the test-only keys are likewise stripped
from the filtered view (default-deny), so they never reach the navigator
either.  The import-time completeness assertion below keeps the classification
complete and disjoint over all three classes, so a key added to the schema
without a classification fails everything loudly, not just one test.

:mod:`spindoctor.sim.scene` is the public entry point: it consumes this
inventory for validation, builds the filtered navigator view from the
classification, and re-exports the boundary names.
