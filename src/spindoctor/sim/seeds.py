"""Deterministic seed derivation for the simulator's randomized effects.

Every randomized effect in the simulator (background noise, background stars,
crater placement, and any effect added later) must draw from a stream that is
byte-identical across processes and runs for identical inputs.  Python's
built-in ``hash`` is unsuitable: it is salted per process for ``str`` and
``bytes`` (controlled by ``PYTHONHASHSEED``), so ``hash((seed, 'noise'))``
varies between interpreter runs.  These helpers derive sub-seeds from a stable
cryptographic digest instead, so the same scene always renders the same pixels.

Sub-seeds are derived per effect *by name* rather than by draw order.  Adding a
new randomized effect therefore does not perturb the seeds of pre-existing
effects, which keeps earlier rendered scenes and their regression baselines
stable when a new effect lands.
