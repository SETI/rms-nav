"""Dropping a results index from the command line.

The destructive half of the statistics system.  It opens the database the URL
names, finds out whether that database holds a SpinDoctor index at all, says
what of one is in it, asks whoever typed the command whether that is what they
meant, removes those tables and stops.  It never walks a results tree: dropping
is a deliberate act, not the opening move of a long ingest, and a command that
did both would make a mistyped URL expensive twice over.

The account of what is about to go is written to the log, which is where
everything else ``sd_stats_ingest`` does is written.  The one thing this module
puts on standard output itself is the question, which ``input`` writes there: a
prompt is a dialogue rather than a report, and carrying it in the log alone
would leave a run whose log was routed to a file waiting silently for an answer.

**A database has to prove it holds an index before anything is dropped from
it.**  The proof is the index's own stamp table, and the schema that stamp was
found in is the only schema anything is dropped from.  A database holding tables
that merely share these names -- ``images`` above all -- is refused and named,
because nothing can tell somebody else's table from the remains of an index of
ours, and a destructive command must not decide such a thing on its own.

Two questions this answers by reporting rather than by refusing:

**An ingest run that has not finished does not stop a drop.**  Such a run is
either a pass writing the index at this moment or one that died, and nothing in
the index tells the two apart -- there is no heartbeat and no process to ask.
A pass that died is also the commonest reason to want a drop, so refusing on
that evidence would withhold the command from the case that needs it most, in
order to guard a case the confirmation already guards.  It is therefore counted
and said out loud, before the question is asked, so that the person who is about
to shoot a live ingest is told so while there is still an answer to give.  What
a drop under a live pass costs is that pass, which fails on a table that has
gone and leaves nothing behind: an unfinished run already reads as "not
ingested" to every consumer, so no reader is told anything different before and
after.

**Another process holding the database does not stop a drop either.**  Neither
backend can be asked the question honestly: SQLite's readers take no lock to
observe under write-ahead logging, and a PostgreSQL role need not be allowed to
read the server's activity view.  What can be done is to make the attempt fail
rather than hang, which
:data:`~spindoctor.results_index.drop.DROP_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` does for the reading
and for the drop alike, and to leave nothing half-finished when it does, which
the transaction around the drop does on both backends.  So the database itself
decides, promptly and per table, instead of a guess deciding beforehand.
