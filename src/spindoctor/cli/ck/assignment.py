"""Which baseline kernel each image's correction belongs to, and where it goes.

A corrected C-kernel is an overlay on exactly one original: it carries the
segments of the images whose attitude that original supplied, under the
original's own name with ``_nav`` before the extension.  Deciding which
original that is cannot be a guess.  The metadata records sorted kernel
basenames with no load order, accumulated across a batch, so several of them
may describe the right object over the right epochs while only one of them is
the file the navigation actually read.

So the pairing is made by reproduction.  Each candidate is furnished on its own
and asked for the attitude the image navigated against; a candidate that
answers the recorded ``cmatrix_original`` to within a nanoradian supplied that
baseline, and one that does not, did not.  An image no candidate reproduces
receives no segment at all: that is also the detector for a kernel set that has
changed since navigation ran, since a corrected segment measured against a
baseline that no longer exists is worse than no segment.

How the attitude is asked for follows how it was navigated.  Most instruments
evaluate a frame chain at the exposure midtime, which ``pxform`` reproduces.
Voyager does not: its observation frame is frozen from a single
tolerance-snapped pointing lookup, so reproducing it means making the same
lookup, at the same clock tick, with the same tolerance, and composing the same
fixed platform-to-camera rotation on top.  There are two such lookups to try,
because oops falls back to a second, far wider tolerance when the first finds
nothing, and each encodes the epoch its own way.

The caller owns the kernel pool.  The supporting kernels -- leapseconds, the
spacecraft clock navigation used, and the frame kernel defining the camera and
CK object frames -- must be furnished before assignment runs, and no C-kernel
may be, since a stray one answers the same lookups and would make the
reproduction test meaningless.
