"""The pre-index of candidate C-kernels a corrected segment can be built on.

An image's metadata records which SPICE kernels were furnished when it
navigated, but it records sorted basenames only: no load order, no directory,
and in a batch run the list accumulates every kernel earlier images needed, so
it is a superset of the ones this image actually used.  Identifying the
baseline kernel an image navigated against therefore takes two steps, and this
module is the first of them: scan every C-kernel under the kernel directories
once per run, recording which objects each file describes and over what epochs,
so that the second step -- furnishing candidates one at a time and keeping the
ones that reproduce the recorded attitude -- has only a handful of files to try
per image instead of the whole holdings.

The scan uses ``ckobj`` and ``ckcov`` at segment level in TDB.  Both read a
file by name, so no C-kernel has to be furnished to be indexed, but the
leapseconds kernel and the spacecraft clock kernel of every object encountered
must be, since that is what converts a coverage window from clock ticks into
TDB.  An object whose clock is not furnished contributes no coverage and is
recorded as unreadable instead, because a real kernel can name an object no
clock kernel describes and no run should be stopped by an object none of its
images asks about; an image that does ask about one is refused by the
assignment step.  Both calls also need a real local file, so a kernel tree that
lives remotely is fetched as it is scanned; for a tree that is already local
nothing is copied.

Coverage is read with a tolerance for the objects whose attitude was navigated
through a tolerance-snapped pointing lookup.  Such a lookup answers with a
record up to its tolerance away from the epoch asked for, so an exposure just
outside a segment's window is still served by that segment, and a coverage
filter that did not allow for it would drop the only candidate that reproduces.
The filter is only a filter: reproduction, not coverage, decides.
