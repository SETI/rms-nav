"""The report of what became of every image a generator run considered.

A corrected C-kernel says where a camera was pointing; it does not say how well
that was measured, and it says nothing at all about the images that got no
segment.  Both are what this report is for.  One row per image, one file per
mission: the image's own measurement as the navigation recorded it, and then
either the corrected file carrying its segment or the reason it has none.  An
image appears exactly once, and never with neither.

Nothing here is a judgment.  The confidence, rank, status and status reason are
reported as recorded, unrounded where the pipeline left them unrounded and
rounded where it rounded them, because a consumer filtering low-confidence or
conflicted pointing out of a kernel has no other place to read them from -- the
generator itself applies no threshold.

The column set is expected to grow as consumers ask for more; it is written
with a header row so that a reader keys on names rather than positions.
