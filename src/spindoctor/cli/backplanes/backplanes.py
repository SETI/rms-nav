"""Generate per-pixel geometry backplanes for one navigated image.

The stage reads the image's navigation record, applies the pointing that record
supplies, computes the body and ring backplanes on the pointed observation, and
writes them as one FITS file.  Where the record comes from is the caller's
choice: a :class:`~spindoctor.cli.reproj.pointing_source.PointingSource` reads it
either from the ``_metadata.json`` document the navigator wrote or from one row
of an ingested results index.  Both supply the same record fields and both
classify the pointing with the same classifier, so the backplanes an image gets
do not depend on which of them the run was pointed at.  The record shapes whose
degradation the two storages *name* differently, none of which changes the
product, are stated in that module.

An image whose navigation did not succeed produces no backplanes, and an image
nothing navigated at all raises rather than producing them on uncorrected
pointing.  The distinction is the point: a backplane computed on a pointing
nobody navigated is geometry for a place the camera was not quite looking, and
the product carries no sign of it.

    Parameters:
        obs_class: Observation snapshot class for the instrument.
        image_files: List of images; must have exactly one image in the batch.
        pointing_source: Where this image's navigation record is read from --
            the documents the navigator wrote, or an ingested results index.
        backplane_results_root: Destination root for FITS and label files.
        write_output_files: Whether to write outputs to storage.
        run_logging: This run's resolved logging, giving the level and sinks
            the per-image log is written with.  ``None`` resolves the
            configuration's defaults against the backplane results root.

    Returns:
        ``{'status': 'success'}`` -- carrying ``pointing_source`` (one of
        ``'cmatrix'``, ``'pool'``, ``'offset'``, ``'none'``) naming which
        recorded pointing the product was built on, plus ``pointing_reason``
        when the outcome carries one, plus
        ``uncorrected_pointing`` when that source is ``'none'`` and the
        backplanes were computed on the camera's uncorrected pointing -- or
        ``{'status': 'skipped'}`` with the navigation status that caused the
        skip.  An image can be skipped or degraded for a reason its caller
        has no other way to learn: the reason is reported to the run's log,
        and a cloud task has no run log, so returning it is what keeps a
        batch that quietly skipped or degraded everything distinguishable
        from one that processed it.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if more than one image is batched, which is a defect in the
