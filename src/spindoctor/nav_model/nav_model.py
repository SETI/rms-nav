"""NavModel — the base class for predicted-scene generators.

Each NavModel renders the predicted appearance of one part of the scene
(stars, a body, or rings) given the observation's SPICE prediction.  The
orchestrator iterates registered NavModel instances and asks each to
contribute features and annotations to the navigation pipeline:

- ``create_model`` populates the model's internal state and metadata.
- ``to_features(context)`` returns ``NavFeature`` instances ready for
  technique consumption.
- ``to_annotations(context)`` returns an ``Annotations`` collection for
  the summary PNG.

Concrete NavModel subclasses self-register via ``__init_subclass__``.  The
module-level ``build_models_for_obs`` function iterates the registry and
asks each subclass to construct whatever instances apply to the
observation; this is what the top-level navigation driver uses so it does
not need to know which scene categories exist.

Every NavModel inherits from ``NavBase`` so it gets the project logger and
config plumbing automatically.
