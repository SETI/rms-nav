"""The navigator's predicted-body renderer for simulated scenes.

Renders the smooth Lambert ellipsoid ``NavModelBodySimulated`` predicts
from a scene's idealized body geometry.  This is deliberately the
navigator's *best model*, not the image: surface texture (craters, relief)
is truth-side information rendered only by the image-side twin
(``spindoctor.sim.forward.body``), and the difference between the two is
exactly the model error a scene plants.  Shading conventions are shared
with the image side through :mod:`spindoctor.sim.ellipsoid_geometry`, so
that planted difference is the only difference.

    The body is modeled as a 3D ellipsoid projected onto 2D and illuminated
    using Lambertian shading (cos(incidence)) based on the illumination
    direction and phase angle.

    Parameters:
        size: Tuple of (size_v, size_u) giving the image dimensions in pixels.
        center: Tuple of (v, u) giving the center position in floating-point pixels.
            (0.0, 0.0) is the top-left corner of pixel (0,0), (0.5, 0.5) is the
            center of pixel (0,0).
        axis1: The full width of axis 1 (a) of the ellipsoid in pixels.
        axis2: The full width of axis 2 (b) of the ellipsoid in pixels.
        axis3: The full width of axis 3 (c) of the ellipsoid in pixels (depth).
        rotation_z: Rotation angle around the viewing axis (z-axis) in radians (0 to 2pi).
        rotation_tilt: Tilt angle of the ellipsoid in radians (0 to pi/2).
            Controls how much the ellipsoid is tilted toward/away from the viewer.
        illumination_angle: Direction of illumination in the image plane in radians (0 to 2pi).
            0 radians is at the top of the image, pi/2 is to the right.
        phase_angle: Phase angle in radians (0 to pi).
            0 = head-on illumination (fully illuminated),
            pi/2 = side illumination (half illuminated),
            pi = back illumination (no visible illumination).
        anti_aliasing: Float between 0 and 1 controlling anti-aliasing amount at the limb.
            0 = no anti-aliasing, 1 = maximum anti-aliasing. Only affects the edge.

    Returns:
        A 2D numpy array of shape (size_v, size_u) with float values from 0.0 to 1.0,
        where 0.0 is black and 1.0 is full white.
