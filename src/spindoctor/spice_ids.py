"""SPICE ids shared by the attitude computation and the C-kernel writer.

The first fact recorded here is which spacecraft clock a C-kernel object's time
tags are encoded against.  ``cspyce.ckmeta`` computes that mapping rather than
validating it -- it answers -999 for the nonexistent object -999999 without
raising -- so a wrong CK object id yields a plausible clock id, a successful
encoding, and silently wrong time tags on every record.  Every consumer
therefore checks what ``ckmeta`` resolves against the mapping below instead of
trusting it, and every consumer reads this one mapping: a second copy of these
numbers is a way for one side's check to rot while the other side's keeps
passing.

The second is which CK object each Voyager spacecraft's scan platform is, and
the set of objects whose navigated attitude is frozen across the exposure.
Those are one fact stated twice: the Voyager host builds its observation frame
from a single tolerance-snapped pointing lookup rather than an evaluated frame
chain, so the frozen set is exactly the Voyager platforms and is derived from
them rather than written out again.

The clock is not derivable from the CK object by arithmetic.  Python's
``-31100 // 1000`` is -32, which is the other Voyager, so each object states
its clock explicitly.

This module holds constants and imports only the standard library.
