"""Corrected-attitude C-matrices for a navigated observation.

A C-matrix is the rotation taking a vector expressed in J2000 to the same vector
expressed in a camera frame::

    v_frame = C . v_J2000

which is what ``cspyce.pxform('J2000', frame_name, et)`` returns.  Navigation
measures a pixel offset; this module converts that offset into the corrected
attitude the camera actually had, so the same measurement can later be written
into a C-kernel and consumed by any SPICE-aware tool without applying a pixel
offset by hand.

Two matrices are produced per navigated image, both in the SPICE camera frame
convention and both at the exposure midtime:

``cmatrix_original``
    The attitude the furnished kernels gave at navigation time, before any
    correction.
``cmatrix``
    The corrected attitude, the one a kernel should carry.

The oops observation frame is **not** the SPICE camera frame.  For three of the
four supported instruments oops builds its frame with a constant flip ``R`` on
top of the SPICE frame, so that ``C_oops = R . C_spice``:

============================  ==========================
Instrument                    ``R``
============================  ==========================
Cassini ISS (NAC, WAC)        ``diag(-1, -1, +1)``
New Horizons LORRI            ``diag(+1, -1, -1)``
Galileo SSI                   identity
Voyager ISS                   identity by construction
============================  ==========================

A correction built in the oops frame and composed onto a ``pxform``-derived
matrix without conjugating through ``R`` is a proper rotation of the right
magnitude pointing the wrong way, so ``R`` is measured at runtime and checked
against the value above rather than assumed.

Voyager is the exception to everything: oops freezes the observation frame from
a tolerance-snapped ``ckgp`` lookup rather than evaluating a frame chain, so
``pxform`` at the midtime does not reproduce it.  For Voyager the observation
frame attitude already **is** the SPICE camera frame attitude, and ``R`` is the
identity by construction.

The offset-to-rotation conversion lives here, behind one entry point, so that
when oops grows its own corrected-attitude API this module's body is replaced
and its interface stays.

) -> CmatrixApplication:
    """Point an observation at its recorded corrected attitude.

    This is the reading half of :func:`compute_pointing`: it inverts the
    writer's conjugation, replacing the observation's frame with one whose
    midtime attitude is the recorded ``cmatrix``, while the field of view is
    left untouched.  With ``C_oops`` the observation frame's own midtime
    attitude, the replacement is ``R_hat . cmatrix`` where ``R_hat = C_oops .
    cmatrix_original^T`` -- the observation's attitude composed with the
    recorded correction.  A record whose correction is the identity
    (``cmatrix`` equal to ``cmatrix_original`` as arrays) short-circuits to
    ``C_oops`` itself, so no correction means exactly no change.

    Before anything is applied, the record is gated:

    1. Both matrices must be proper rotations of real numbers and
       ``midtime_et`` finite.
    2. ``midtime_et`` must equal the observation's own midtime to a
       microsecond: the recorded attitude is a midtime attitude, so a record
       from another observation is refused rather than applied.
    3. ``R_hat`` must equal the instrument's constant oops-from-SPICE flip to
       the writer's own tolerance.  Because ``R_hat`` mixes the observation's
       *current* attitude with the *recorded* baseline, this one inequality
       fails on a changed kernel pool, a transposed ``cmatrix_original`` or
       whole record, and a changed host convention alike.  The one sub-case
       it cannot see is a transposed ``cmatrix`` alone, which no
       single-serializer defect produces: the inequality contains only
       ``cmatrix_original``.
    4. When that gate fails, one probe distinguishes the known non-defect
       state: a pool that already answers the corrected attitude (corrected
       kernels furnished at load time).  There the observation is already
       right and nothing is applied.

    The replacement frame is built unregistered, so batch loops pollute no
    global oops frame state, and it carries zero angular velocity where the
    original carried the spacecraft's -- no switched consumer reads frame
    omega, but a future velocity-aware one must not consume it from the
    replaced frame.  The observation's cached geometry is NOT cleared here:
    a caller that has touched any derived geometry (a ``Backplane``, the
    center scan ``from_file`` itself performs) must call ``obs.reset_all()``
    after a replacement, or rebuild products on the stale cache --
    :func:`spindoctor.cli.reproj.offsets.apply_pointing_to_obs` does exactly
    that and is the entry point the pipeline's consumers use.

    Parameters:
        obs: The observation to point, mutated in place.
        cmatrix: The recorded corrected J2000-to-camera rotation, SPICE
            convention, at the exposure midtime.
        cmatrix_original: The recorded uncorrected rotation, same convention
            and epoch.
        midtime_et: The recorded exposure midtime, TDB seconds past J2000.

    Returns:
        ``CmatrixApplication.FRAME_REPLACED`` when the observation's frame
        was replaced with the corrected attitude, or
        ``CmatrixApplication.POOL_ALREADY_CORRECTED`` when the furnished pool
        already answered the corrected attitude and the observation was
        deliberately left untouched -- the caller must then apply nothing
        else, in particular not the pixel offset, which would double-correct.

    Raises:
        NavPointingError: for every expected failure, carrying a
            machine-readable ``reason``: ``malformed_pointing`` when either
            matrix or the midtime is unusable, ``cmatrix_unknown_host`` when
            the observation's instrument has no frame mapping to gate
            against, ``cmatrix_foreign_midtime`` when the record belongs to
            another observation, and ``cmatrix_baseline_mismatch`` when
            ``R_hat`` fails its gate for no known non-defect reason.  The
            observation is never mutated on a raise.
