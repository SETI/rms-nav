"""Routing of log records to the main or the image logger.

Two loggers exist, and every component belongs to exactly one.  Components
whose work spans a run -- enumerating a dataset, tallying totals -- belong to
the main logger.  Components working on one image belong to the image logger.

The image logger is reached through :data:`IMAGE_LOGGER`, a proxy rather than
a logger.  Opening a section on it enters an image scope; while that scope is
open the proxy forwards to the real logger underneath, and every nested
section, model and technique writes into the same per-image log.  Outside any
scope there is nothing sensible to forward to, so the proxy routes the record
to the main logger and warns once about the call site.  With
``logging.strict_scope`` enabled it raises instead; that is off by default,
because one mis-scoped call should not abort a batch over a log line.

Configuring the image logger -- setting a level, attaching a handler -- is not
the same as logging to it, and is a reasonable thing to do before any image is
open.  Those calls reach the image logger directly and never report a
violation.

Logging from an image-scoped component with no image open is a defect rather
than a mode to support.  Every occurrence found while this was written was
either correctly scoped or a component bound to the wrong logger.
