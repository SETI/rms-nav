"""Key namespace and validation for the ``logging`` configuration section.

The ``logging`` section names each configurable module by a snake_case key.
For navigation techniques and models those keys are derived from the class
name by :func:`log_key_for`, so a key is always recoverable from the source
and never has to be maintained as a parallel list that can fall out of date.
A class may override its derived key by declaring a ``log_key`` class
attribute.

:func:`validate_logging_config` rejects an unrecognized module key, program
name, or level name when the configuration is loaded, so a typo fails at
startup instead of silently having no effect.  It lives here rather than on
:class:`~spindoctor.config.config.Config` because it needs the technique and
model registries, and those packages import ``spindoctor.config``; the
registry imports are therefore function-local and happen only when validation
runs.
