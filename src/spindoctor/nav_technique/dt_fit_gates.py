"""Shared fit-quality gates for the distance-transform techniques.

The DT techniques (``BodyLimbNav``, ``BodyTerminatorNav``, ``RingEdgeNav``)
share the coarse-NCC + Levenberg-Marquardt + Tukey machinery of
:mod:`spindoctor.nav_technique.dt_fitting`; this module is the shared verdict
layer over that machinery's health signals.  Three signals feed it:

- **LM convergence.**  ``LMRefineResult.converged=False`` means the LM bailed
  at its iteration cap without ever meeting the step-norm tolerance -- an
  unverified fit.  The consequence is a confidence DEMOTION, not a reject: an
  LM at the cap usually sits near its (trust-region-bounded) seed, so a hard
  reject would strafe healthy frames that merely oscillate at the tolerance
  boundary, but the fit has not earned a high-tier vote either.
- **Polarity-rejection fraction.**  The fraction of model vertices whose
  local image gradient direction disagrees with the model's outward normal at
  the seed.  Healthy multi-body frames run around 11 % (small secondary
  bodies on an ansa contribute wrong-polarity vertices while the dominant
  limb fits cleanly), so the standalone threshold is set far above that; the
  discriminating form is the COMBINED gate -- an unconverged LM whose
  polarity rejection is also elevated is the signature of a coarse-seed
  mis-lock that the LM could neither escape nor verify (the Cassini Tethys
  body-mostly-offscreen investigation measured 12.7 % rejection at the
  30-iteration cap on a seed 6.8 px off).
- **Coarse-NCC peak quality.**  The winning coarse shift's per-vertex match
  fraction (:class:`~spindoctor.nav_technique.dt_fitting.CoarseSearchResult`).
  A seed whose best shift still leaves most of the model off every detected
  edge never had a lock to refine; the LM then polishes noise.  This gate
  ships as plumbing plus a conservative default; a library-calibrated
  threshold lock is separate follow-on calibration work.

All thresholds are per-technique config
(``techniques.<name>.tuning`` in ``config_510_techniques.yaml``); the config
dataclass fails fast on a missing key, matching the techniques' own tuning
pattern.
