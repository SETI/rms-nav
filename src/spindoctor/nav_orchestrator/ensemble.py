"""Ensemble — reconcile per-technique results into a single NavResult.

The ensemble is the single point in the pipeline where multiple per-technique
estimates become one offset.  Every step is honest:

1. Drop ``spurious=True`` results.
2. Drop ``at_edge=True`` results unless dropping them would empty the set.
3. Select the consensus subset: every result sponsors the set of results
   that agree with it pairwise (Mahalanobis distance or pixel floor,
   both measured only in the intersection of the two results' observable
   subspaces, so a rank-1 flat-ring measurement and a full-rank absolute
   fix that agree radially can group and fuse); the subset with the
   highest summed confidence wins.
4. Exclude results outside the consensus from the combine.  A lone
   dissenter against a multi-technique consensus is outlier-rejected;
   only a genuine alternative can force the conflicted branch: a
   runner-up consensus with at least two members (absolute
   summed-confidence gap test), or a lone-vs-lone standoff where the
   dissenter's confidence is comparable to the winner's (gap measured
   relative to the winner, so an already-excluded low-confidence
   dissenter retains no veto over a clearly stronger singleton).
   Vote mass, quorum, and the agreement boost count only *corroborating*
   members: a pass-2 result whose prior was seeded by a technique in the
   same subset re-observed its own seed, so it refines the offset but
   casts no independent vote.
5. Resolve the winning subset into mutually independent estimators before
   fusing (``resolve_independent_estimators``): drop a seeded single-star
   refine that only re-observes its own prior, and collapse correlated
   witnesses that share one error source (two ring techniques on one
   catalog; disc and limb on one scattered-light gradient) to a single
   representative.  The information-form merge assumes independence, so
   fusing correlated members would over-tighten the covariance, inflate the
   tier, and let a redundant member drag the offset.
6. Combine offsets within the resolved subset via precision-weighted
   (Kalman-style) merging.
7. Apply optional disagreement / conflict penalties.
8. Cap the confidence tier at ``medium`` when the fused covariance is
   rank-deficient (one translation axis unobservable) or when every
   combined member is a single-star solution (a one-star unique match
   or one-inlier refine) — neither an assumed axis nor an
   un-cross-checked star is ``high``-tier evidence, however tight the
   localization sigma.
9. Emit a NavResult carrying the excluded technique names.

The ensemble is tested in isolation against synthetic per-technique results;
correctness here is what makes the rest of the pipeline trustworthy.

    Defaults match ``config_540_orchestrator.yaml``.

    Parameters:
        agreement_sigma: Mahalanobis-distance threshold for grouping.
        agreement_pixel_floor: Translation-distance fallback grouping
            threshold in pixels.  Two results are grouped when *either*
            their Mahalanobis distance is at most ``agreement_sigma``
            *or* their Euclidean translation distance is at most this
            many pixels.  The pixel floor exists because per-technique
            covariances are CRLB-tight (FFT subpixel localization for
            ``BodyDiscCorrelateNav``, M-estimator information for the
            DT-fit techniques), well below the actual position
            uncertainty driven by model error and pointing residuals;
            without the floor, results agreeing visually to a few px
            register as hundreds of sigmas apart and never group.
            Set to ``0.0`` to disable the floor.
        agreement_gap: Minimum summed-confidence gap between best and
            runner-up groups before declaring a conflict.  Applied as an
            absolute gap when the runner-up has a quorum (two or more
            members); in a lone-vs-lone standoff (singleton best against
            a singleton excluded dissenter) the gap is measured relative
            to the winner — conflict fires only when
            ``best - runner_up < agreement_gap * best`` — so a dissenter
            with well under ``(1 - agreement_gap)`` of the winner's
            confidence cannot veto it.
        disagreement_penalty: Multiplier on combined confidence when more
            than one group existed.
        conflicted_confidence_multiplier: Additional multiplier when the
            conflicted branch fires.
        min_confidence: Final-result threshold below which the ensemble
            returns NavResult.failed instead of NavResult.ok.
        pinvh_rcond: rcond for ``scipy.linalg.pinvh``.
        max_allowed_rotation_deg: Maximum magnitude (in degrees) a 3-DoF
            result's rotation may take before the ensemble rejects it.
            The rotation parameter is combined as a small angle (circular
            mean of ``(dv, du, theta)`` triples); this bound enforces the
            small-angle assumption that every contributing technique fits
            against (every DT/star technique clamps its rotation to
            ``+-max_rotation_deg``, default 5 deg).  A 3-DoF result
            arriving with ``abs(rotation_rad)`` at or above this bound is a
            programming error upstream and raises ``NavContractError``.
        scattered_light_gradient_score: Background-gradient score at or
            above which the frame is treated as scattered-light, so the disc
            and limb techniques on one body are fused as a single correlated
            witness rather than two independent ones (see
            ``resolve_independent_estimators``).

    Weights are ``trace(pinvh(Sigma_i[:2, :2]))`` -- the positional (v, u)
    precision in ``px^-2``, with any rotation axis marginalised out so the
    weight is not skewed by the unrelated ``rad^-2`` rotation precision of a
    3-DoF result.  Tighter covariances contribute more to the combined
    confidence than loose ones.  The boosted combined
    confidence reflects the number of significant contributors, capped per
    ``AGREEMENT_FACTOR_CAP`` and ``COMBINED_CONFIDENCE_CAP``.

    Parameters:
        group: Non-empty list of agreeing results.
