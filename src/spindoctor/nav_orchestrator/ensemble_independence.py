"""Resolve a consensus group into mutually independent estimators.

The ensemble fuses agreeing per-technique results with an information-form
(Kalman-style) merge whose every step assumes the inputs are *independent*
measurements: their precisions add, and their mutual agreement earns a
confidence boost.  That assumption is false whenever two results draw on the
same underlying error source.  Fusing correlated results as independent both
over-tightens the combined covariance (so the reported sigma is too small and
the tier too high) and lets a redundant member drag the fused offset.

This module resolves a winning consensus group into the set of estimators the
combine may treat as independent, correcting three known correlations:

* **Seeded second-pass refine (R1).**  A pass-2 ``StarRefineNav`` searches a
  small window around the pass-1 prior, so its offset is conditionally
  dependent on whichever techniques seeded that prior
  (``prior_source_techniques``).  A refine that rests on a *single* star adds
  no independent constraint of its own -- it merely re-observes its seed near
  the predicted position -- and its CRLB-tight covariance would otherwise let
  it dominate the precision-weighted merge.  So a seeded single-star refine is
  dropped from the combine when the group also holds a stronger, non-single-
  star witness (a body or ring fix, or a multi-star result) that it would
  otherwise drag off; a genuine single-star lock, where the refine is the
  only refinement of a legitimately weak fix and no stronger witness is
  present, keeps it.  A multi-star refine always carries independent
  information and is kept (the ensemble separately denies it a corroboration
  vote).

* **Two ring techniques on one catalog (R2).**  ``RingEdgeNav`` and
  ``RingAnnulusNav`` observe the same predicted ring geometry from the same
  catalog model, so a radially misplaced catalog puts both wrong in the same
  direction by the same amount.  They are collapsed to a single representative
  witness.

* **Disc and limb on one veiling gradient (R3).**  On a scattered-light frame
  ``BodyDiscCorrelateNav`` and ``BodyLimbNav`` both lock onto the same
  large-scale brightness ramp rather than the body, so their errors correlate.
  When the image's background-gradient score exceeds the scattered-light
  threshold, the disc and limb results on the same body are collapsed to a
  single representative.

R1 is a directional drop (the descendant is subordinate to its seeds, which
remain independent of one another); R2 and R3 are symmetric collapses (neither
member is subordinate, so the pair is replaced by one representative).  The
representative of a collapsed set is its highest-positional-precision member,
with a deterministic tie-break, so the fused offset is the single best view of
the shared measurement rather than a spuriously tightened average of two.
