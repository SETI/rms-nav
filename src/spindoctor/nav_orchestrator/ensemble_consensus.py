"""Consensus-subset selection for the ensemble combine.

Given the viable per-technique results, decide which subset the ensemble
fuses and which results are outliers.  Every result sponsors the subset
that agrees with it pairwise (Mahalanobis distance or pixel floor, both
measured only in the observable-subspace intersection); the highest
summed-confidence subset wins.  This machinery lives apart from
``ensemble`` so that module stays under the 1000-line limit; ``ensemble``
imports :func:`consensus_selection` and :func:`result_param_vector`.

    Two results agree iff *either* their pairwise Mahalanobis distance is

    most ``agreement_pixel_floor``.

    The Mahalanobis distance differences the rotation component of two
    3-DoF results linearly; that is correct here because every input
    rotation is bounded to the small-angle window enforced by the caller,
    so the pairwise angle difference never approaches the ``+-pi`` wrap.

    The pixel floor compensates for per-technique covariances that
    report only a CRLB-style precision (FFT subpixel localization or
    M-estimator information) and so under-estimate the actual position
    uncertainty by orders of magnitude.  See ``EnsembleConfig`` for the
    motivation.
