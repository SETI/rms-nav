# Pull Request Standards

## 1. General Principles

1. **Descriptive title** — Summarize the change in an imperative sentence (e.g., "Add caching to profile lookup").
2. **Purpose first** — Explain *why* the change is needed before *how* it was done.
3. **Scope** — One logical change per PR. Split unrelated changes into separate PRs.
4. **Testing evidence** — Document automated and manual testing performed.
5. **Impact assessment** — Note potential effects on the public API, performance, or dependent packages.
6. **Linked issues** — Reference related GitHub issues using `Closes #NNN` syntax.

## 2. GitHub PR Template

Place this in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for automatic use.

```markdown
## Purpose

<!-- Why is this change needed? What problem does it solve? -->

Closes #<!-- issue number -->

## Implementation

<!-- How was it implemented? Why were specific approaches chosen? -->

## Testing

### Automated
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests added/updated

### Manual
<!-- Steps to manually verify the change, if applicable. -->

## Potential Impacts

<!-- Effects on the public API, backward compatibility, performance, or downstream packages. -->

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines (PEP 8, 100-char line length)
- [ ] All CI checks pass (ruff, mypy, pytest)
- [ ] Documentation and docstrings updated (if applicable)
- [ ] No new warnings, errors, or security issues introduced
- [ ] Version-sensitive changes noted (breaking changes flagged)
```

## 3. Customization Guidance

Adapt the template by considering:

- **Library-specific fields** — Public API changes, deprecation notices, migration notes.
- **Required reviewers** — Tag maintainers for changes to core modules.
- **Brevity vs. completeness** — Keep the template short enough that authors fill it out fully.
