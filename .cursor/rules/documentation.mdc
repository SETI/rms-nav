# Documentation Standards

## 1. Documentation System

- Use **Sphinx** for all project documentation, hosted on **ReadTheDocs**.
- After any code or doc change, run `sphinx-build` on the full documentation tree and fix all warnings and errors before delivering.

## 2. Required Documentation

| Document | Contents | Keep up-to-date? |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Module index** | Every module that exists or is planned (placeholders for future modules). | Yes |
| **Architecture overview** | Class hierarchy, public API surface, and interface contracts. | Yes |
| **Install guide** | `pip install` instructions, supported Python versions, optional dependencies. | Yes |
| **Usage examples** | Common workflows with code snippets and expected output. | Yes |
| **README** | Project summary, PyPI/ReadTheDocs badges, quickstart, and links to full docs. | Yes |

## 3. Docstrings

- EVERY class, method, function, and module MUST have a descriptive docstring.
- Follow **PEP 257** using **Google style** with `Parameters:` (not `Args:`).
- Include `Returns:`, `Raises:`, and behavioral notes sufficient to write a black-box test.
- Wrap docstring text to **90** characters.

## 4. Change Discipline

- Any code change MUST update the relevant docstrings and the README if affected.
- NEVER leave stale or contradictory documentation. If a feature is removed, remove its docs.
