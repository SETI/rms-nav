# Titan planted-truth campaign

A randomized simulated-scene campaign that measures how accurately
`TitanHazeNav` recovers a known pointing offset from a hazy body, how honest
the uncertainty it reports alongside that offset is, and which of its gates
refuse which frames.

The standing per-technique sweeps under `tests/integration/sim_sweeps/`
(`titan_offset_fine`, `titan_offset_wide`) vary one parameter at a time from
one base scene and feed the simulator report's response curves. This campaign
is the other half: many scenes, every parameter drawn at once, aimed at the
statistics — percentiles, z-scores, gate rates — that a stated accuracy bound
and a calibrated sigma rest on.

## Running it

```bash
source /seti/newnav/setup.sh
python util/titan_truth/collect.py --per-family 100 --workers 10 \
    --out _work/titan_truth/rows.jsonl
python util/titan_truth/analyze.py _work/titan_truth/rows.jsonl
```

600 scenes take about a minute on ten workers. `--seed` draws a different
campaign; the default seed is recorded in every run's manifest line, and the
per-scene seed derives from it, so any single scene can be regenerated and
inspected on its own.

## What the scenes contain

Every scene renders Titan at its published radius, at a randomly drawn range
(28-78 px apparent solid radius), phase (10-140 deg), sun direction, read
noise (1.5-16 DN), and planted pointing offset (0-40 px, uniform in
direction). The families differ only in what else is on the frame:

| family | what it adds |
|---|---|
| `clean` | nothing — the estimator's mirror-symmetry assumption holds |
| `clouds` | 1-4 Gaussian clouds on the disc |
| `asymmetry` | tilted haze axis, hemispheric falloff and brightness differences, an interior ramp, a limb sharpness gradient |
| `stars` | 3-12 stars, straddling the mask magnitude limit |
| `artifacts` | cosmic rays and hot pixels at deliberate STRESS incidence |
| `artifacts_nominal` | the same contamination class at the instrument's shipped, realism-matched incidence |
| `combined` | all of the above together |

`clean` is the family the published accuracy bound is stated on; the others
measure how far each broken assumption moves it. Everything the families add
is a truth-side scene key, invisible to the navigator through `nav_params`.

The two artifact families are a matched pair and must not be confused. The
stress one draws hot-pixel incidence an order of magnitude wide and forces a
nonzero cosmic-ray rate the realism recalibration deliberately retained at
zero; it bounds the regime. `artifacts_nominal` overrides nothing and is the
family an operational prediction reads from. `_artifact_blocks` states the
provenance of every stress range.

The sun direction is drawn uniformly over the circle, and the body's in-plane
roll follows it at `rotation_z = illumination_angle - 90`. That roll is what
puts the hemispheric split the structure keys use ACROSS the sun axis, which
is what makes `ns_asymmetry_amplitude` the affine control the design intends:
the mirror about the sun axis has to map one hemisphere onto the other for a
pure brightness scaling to be the invariance being tested. On the
structureless spheres every family renders, an in-plane roll changes no
rendered pixel, so carrying it costs the campaign no angular coverage.

## What the report says

- **Recovery error percentiles per family**, resolved onto the technique's own
  symmetry axis. Cross-track (the mirror-correlation axis) and along-track
  (the limb-arc axis) have different bounds and must not be averaged together.
- **Commit rate by phase bin.** A haze disc near full illumination is close to
  rotationally symmetric, so the mirror-correlation scan grows side lobes and
  the competing-peak gate refuses the frame. The table is where that shows up.
- **Reported-sigma calibration.** The z-score `error / sigma` per axis, both
  over every committed row (what the ensemble consumes) and over the rows whose
  sigma was not clamped to its configured per-axis floor (what
  `cross_sigma_scale` / `along_sigma_scale` actually control). When the
  clamped fraction is large, the floor and not the scale is what sets the
  reported uncertainty, and the printed z-versus-scale curve says whether any
  scale can reach the target band at all.
- **The no-confident-wrong check**: the error distribution restricted to
  results the technique called confident. Provisional while the confidence
  spec carries placeholder anchors.

## Reading a failure

A `FAIL` on a clean-scene bound is a real regression in the estimator. A
`FAIL` on a z-score band with a high clamped fraction is a statement about the
sigma floor, not about the scale — check the z-versus-scale curve printed
beneath it before changing anything. Gate counts moving without an error
percentile moving is a gate-threshold question, not an accuracy one.
