# Simulated Body Generator GUI

This directory contains a Qt6-based GUI application for experimenting with the `create_simulated_body` function from `nav.support.sim`.

## Usage

Run the GUI application:
```bash
python sim_body_gui.py
```

Or make it executable and run directly:
```bash
chmod +x sim_body_gui.py
./sim_body_gui.py
```
